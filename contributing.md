Contributing
===============

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature/hotfix branch
3. Edit and commit the files in `./source/` folder.
4. Make sure `grunt` succeeds
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request into the `develop` branch

Upscuits only uses static files, to be compatible with a variety of servers 
(IIS, Apache, Ngix, NodeJS, ...). We prefer to keep server-side languages 
(ie. PHP) away, and only rely on static files.
